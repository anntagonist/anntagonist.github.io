            <p>
                37 months ago the nation had a catastrophic outbreak of the Dr. Enigma Adenohypophysis Degenerate Virus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The D.E.A.D. Virus has spread throughout the nation, which has been quarantined from the rest of the World,
                in attempt to prevent the virus from spreading.  Due to the quarantine all trades with the outside world has been suspended
                and it is left to the people of the United States to survive.
            </p>

            <p>
                The infected have run rampant, with no morality, killing those they once loved in violent fits of rage, or spreading
                the infection to others through various means.
            </p>

            <p>
                Law Enforcement, Fire Departments, Coast Guard, and the Military Might of the nation rallied to protect the people.
                Everyone was instructed to stay home with their families, locked behind their doors, until containment was fulfilled.
                However due to the ignorance of how to properly identify symptoms of who was already infected, people weren't safe within
                their own homes.

            <p>
                The nation's leaders have gone underground to protect themselves from the threat of the D.E.A.D. Virus, allowing the people
                to turn on one another, build their own territories, and creating their own laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gangs have taken to the streets fighting for resources, land, and shelter.  Mercenaries are taking various jobs that
                people are too scared to do themselves.  Bandits are breaking into homes and camps for supplies.
                The infected are not the only threat out there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Large farms have stopped producing mass amounts of food, meat and dairy products are no longer easily obtained.
                Currency no longer holds any trade value, instead the most basic of resources such as food and water are worth the price
                of shelter and protection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vehicles that run on standard gasoline no longer are of use, due to the gasoline expiring.  Batteries and other
                components of most of the vehicles have been stripped out for all kinds of uses.

            <p>
                A Graduate student working the the field of Biochemistry by the name of Ann believes that she has discovered the cure
                to the D.E.A.D. Virus up in Northern Colorado.  The only problem is that she doesn't have the resources to mass produce
                the vaccine or the means to distribute it throughout the population.
            </p>
            <p>
                The University of Colorado is located in a small town 148 miles South of Ann's current location.  Ann accompanied by
                Johnathan and Michael will have to make their way South to deliver Ann's findings for mass production.
